# Prometheus Integration with TIBCO BusinessWorks

Prometheus Monitoring for TIBCO BusinessWorks is an open source plug-in for TIBCO BusinessWorks Studio. It is designed to monitor JVM, application's activity & process related statistics via [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

To enable Prometheus monitoring for applications running in Docker follow the below steps:
* Add JAR of this plugin in addons/jar folder and build the base image (name it as bwce-base:latest).
* Expose port 9095 in the application's Dockerfile.
* Build the apllication's docker image using base image created in step 1. (i.e. bwce-base:latest)
* Set BW_PROMETHEUS_ENABLE environment variable to TRUE while running the Docker image of the application.
* Run your application using below command:
docker run -d -p 9095:9095 -p exposed-port-by-application:8080 -e BW_PROMETHEUS_ENABLE=TRUE <application-name>
* Add prometheus.yml file and run the Prometheus server using below command:
docker run -p 9090:9090 -v path-to-file/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus:latest --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

To enable Prometheus monitoring for applications running in PCF follow the below steps:
* Set BW_PROMETHEUS_ENABLE environment variable to TRUE in the manifest.yml file of the application.
* Add JAR of this plugin in addons/jar folder and build the buildpack.
* Push your application to the cloud using newly created buildpack. Once application gets started you would be able to see the Prometheus metrics at applications-routable-url/merics endpoint.
* Add promregator.yml file and run the Promregator server using below command:
docker run -d --name promregator -p 127.0.0.1:56710:8080 -v path-to-file/promregator.yml:/etc/promregator/promregator.yml -e CF_PASSWORD=<cloud-foundary-password> promregator/promregator:0.4.1
* Add prometheus.yml file and run the Prometheus server using below command:
docker run --name prometheus -v path-to-file/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 --link promregator prom/prometheus:latest
