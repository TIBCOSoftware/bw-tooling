Sample PromQL to check the application's metrics:

1) Process Instrumentation data metrics have been created. Below are the PromQL to show the metrics
Created, completed, faulted, suspended process details
all_process_events_count
Execution time: Avg, Min, Max, Total
max(process_duration_count) by (ProcessInstanceState)
This will be calculated for Completed Process states only.
Elapsed time: Avg, Min, Max, Total
sum(activity_evaltime_count) by (ProcessInstanceId)

2) Process Monitoring data metrics have been created. Below are the PromQL to show the metrics
Monitor the status of the process instances and subprocesses that were successfully executed, canceled or faulted.
sum (process_state_count) by (ApplicationName, ProcessInstanceState)
Show processes and subprocesses of the selected application
sum (process_stats_total) by (ApplicationName, ComponentProcessName, ParentProcessName)
Show duration time & end time for all instances in the selected process
process_duration_count
We can get the sum, min, max for duration time.

3) Activity Instrumentation data metrics have been created. Below are the PromQL to show the metrics
Faulted, executed, recent status details per activity
sum (activity_state_count) by (ApplicationName, ActivityState)
all_activity_events_count - This will give a list of all activities in the application along with the status.
Elapsed time: Min, Max, Total
min(activity_duration_count) by (ApplicationName, ActivityState)
simiarly min, max, sum
Execution time: Min, Max, Total
min(activity_evaltime_count) by (ApplicationName,ActivityState)
